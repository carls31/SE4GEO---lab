USE CASE 

sign-in : 
 - user:EMPA 
 - condition: The EMPA user can register, going on the website, clicking on      'sign-in'
 - flow of the events: 1. A user opens the web-app
                      2. Clicks on the Log In button

- exception: the user's name already exists in the database 

log-in : 
 - user:EMPA
 - condition: The EMPA user has already sign-up without errors 
 - flow of the events: 1. A user opens the application through a browser
                      2. The user clicks on the "Log In" button.

 - condition: The user has previously succesfully logged in 
 - flow of Events : 1. The user clicks on the "Log Out" button
                    2. The user successfully logout and the system redirects the user to      the homepage

space selection:

 - condition : The user have previously open the homepage 
 - flow of events :1.The user clicks on the "location" bar
                   2. The user select one of the pre-defined locations
   

temporal selection (update dataset):
- user: EMPA
- condition : The user should have previuosly logged in and selected a location  
- flow of events :1. The EMPA user clicks on the "temporal range" bar 
                  2. The EMPA user can select the amount of time for which he/she wants predictions or descriptive statistics (max next 6 hours)
-exception: the user has not successfully log-in into the application 

data visualization of tables: 
- user: EMPA
- condition : The user should have previously logged in 
- flow of events :1. The EMPA user clicks on the button "data"       
                  2. The EMPA user should make query to the database to extract the data of its interest (SQL Language, lo sparo a caso perchè è l'unico che conosco )
     
-exception: the user has not successfully log-in into the application, there is some syntax error in the query 



data visualization of graphs:
-user : cc/Empa 
-flow of events:1. The user clicks on the button "data" 
                2. The user can select the voice "show graphs" that allows the user to see the  ( cosa si intende per graphs?cioè graph di cosa? PLOT of the aoi (selected area or city) showing the content level of one or more pollutant indeces)

higer resolution map/graph: 
-user: EMPA
-condition: The user should have previously logged in
-flow of events: 1. The EMPA user clicks on the button "resolution"
                 2. The EMPA user selects on "lower resolution" or "higher resolution" in order to decrement or increment it 
-exception: the user has not successfully log-in into the application 

show single/multiple pollutant index/indeces:
