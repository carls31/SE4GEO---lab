Develop an interactive application for air quality monitoring

Public authorities collect air quality and weather observations in near-real time from ground
sensor stations and store them in digital archives. Generally, ground sensors data are
composed of long time series of observations and sensors metadata (including coordinates,
type of measured variable, etc.). Often, observations from different sensors and/or providers
require different patterns for data accessing, harmonization, and processing. To this end,
interactive applications and dashboards, capable of facilitating such tasks, are key for
supporting both public authorities as well as ordinary citizens in data processing and
visualization. The purpose of this project is to design and develop an interactive client-server
application to perform the above tasks.
